HW1 Classification with Cross Validation 
- Use wrapper to run the script
- Iris data set is used
- Includes KNN and Naive Bayes classifiers
- Calculates n fold cross validation for variety of values for n
- Identifies optimal number of folds for highest accuracy
- Argparse options for selecting only one classifier

HW2 Logistic Regression with Regularization
- Use wrapper to run the script
- Iris data set is used
- User inputs number of folds for cross validation
- Scores logistic regression models with variety of values for the regularization parameter C (note: lower values for C result in higher regularization)
- Identifies value for C with optimal accuracy

HW3 Random Forest using Spambase Public Data Set
- Uses spambase data set from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase
- Graphs histogram for each of the 57 features
- Applies 2 fold cross validation to separate data set into training and testing sets
- Creates 2 ROC curves and calculates AUC using 2 fold cross validation
