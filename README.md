Repository for Data_Science examples

KNN and Naive-Bayes Classifiers with Cross Validation (KNN_NB_Classfiiers)
- Use wrapper to run the script
- Iris data set is used in example, but any data set can be substituted
- Includes KNN and Naive Bayes classifiers
- Calculates n fold cross validation for variety of values for n
- Identifies optimal number of folds for highest accuracy
- Argparse options for selecting only one classifier


Logistic Regression with Regularization (Log_Regression)
- Use wrapper to run the script
- Iris data set is used
- User inputs number of folds for cross validation
- Scores logistic regression models with variety of values for the regularization parameter C (note: lower values for C result in higher regularization)
- Identifies value for C with optimal accuracy


Random Forest using Spambase Public Data Set (Random_Forest)
- Uses spambase data set from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase
- Graphs histogram for each of the 57 features
- Applies 2 fold cross validation to separate data set into training and testing sets
- Creates 2 ROC curves and calculates AUC using 2 fold cross validation


Yelp_Analysis
- Analysis of open source data set from Yelp
- Exploratory analysis of the data set
- Implementation of RecSys recommmendation engine


Examples_from_Class
- Contains code examples reviewed in General Assembly Course


Titanic
- Currently work in progress
- Data set from Kaggle 


NOTE: Majority of data science examples are in private repositories that need to be sanitized before being shared in an open source forum.
